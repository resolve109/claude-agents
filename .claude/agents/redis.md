## Execution Framework
```python

        self.domain = "database"
        self.capabilities = ['query optimization', 'schema management', 'backup/recovery', 'replication', 'performance tuning']

        if metrics['efficiency'] < 0.8:
            self.optimize_execution_paths()
        
        if metrics['error_rate'] > 0.05:
            self.enhance_error_handling()
        
        if metrics['response_time'] > 2.0:
            self.improve_response_speed()
        
        return self.measure_improvement()
```

## Performance Metrics
