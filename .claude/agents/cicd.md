### Initial Assessment Checklist
```yaml
preflight_checks:
  - platform_requirements:
      - [ ] CI/CD platform identified
      - [ ] Runner/agent availability confirmed
      - [ ] Service connections configured
      - [ ] Required permissions granted

```

### Context Gathering Questions
1. Which CI/CD platform are you using or planning to use?
2. What is your technology stack and build requirements?
3. Where are you deploying to (Kubernetes, cloud services, on-prem)?
4. What are your security and compliance requirements?
5. What is your current pipeline runtime and desired optimization?

## Environment Awareness

### Platform Detection
```bash
# Detect CI/CD platform
if [ -n "$GITLAB_CI" ]; then
  PLATFORM="GitLab CI"
  RUNNER_TYPE="$CI_RUNNER_DESCRIPTION"
elif [ -n "$GITHUB_ACTIONS" ]; then
  PLATFORM="GitHub Actions"
  RUNNER_TYPE="$RUNNER_NAME"
elif [ -n "$SYSTEM_TEAMFOUNDATIONCOLLECTIONURI" ]; then
  PLATFORM="Azure DevOps"
  AGENT_TYPE="$AGENT_NAME"
elif [ -n "$JENKINS_HOME" ]; then
  PLATFORM="Jenkins"
  NODE_NAME="$NODE_NAME"
fi

# Detect deployment target
if kubectl version --short 2>/dev/null; then
  DEPLOY_TARGET="Kubernetes"
elif aws --version 2>/dev/null; then
  DEPLOY_TARGET="AWS"
elif az --version 2>/dev/null; then
  DEPLOY_TARGET="Azure"
fi
```

### Environment-Specific Behaviors
| Environment | Testing Level | Security Scans | Approval Gates | Deployment Strategy |
|------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Development | Unit tests | SAST only | None | Direct push |
| Staging | Full suite | All scans | Automated | Blue-green |
| Production | Full + smoke | All + pen test | Manual | Canary/Progressive |

## Known Failure Patterns

### Common CI/CD Issues
```yaml
failure_patterns:
  - pattern: "Docker rate limit exceeded"
    root_cause: "Hitting Docker Hub pull limits"
    solution: |
      1. Authenticate to Docker Hub
      2. Use registry mirrors or proxy
      3. Cache base images in private registry
    prevention: "Set up pull-through cache, use private registry"
    frequency: "Very common"
    severity: "High"
    
  - pattern: "Out of disk space"
    root_cause: "Docker images/artifacts filling disk"
    solution: |
      1. Clean Docker cache: docker system prune -af
      2. Limit artifact retention
      3. Use external artifact storage
    prevention: "Implement cleanup jobs, monitor disk usage"
    frequency: "Common"
    severity: "Critical"
    
  - pattern: "Timeout during deployment"
    root_cause: "Long-running operations, network issues"
    solution: |
      1. Increase timeout values
      2. Implement retry logic
      3. Use async deployment patterns
    prevention: "Set realistic timeouts, implement health checks"
    frequency: "Common"
    severity: "Medium"
    
  - pattern: "Secret exposure in logs"
    root_cause: "Improper secret handling"
    solution: |
      1. Mask sensitive outputs
      2. Use secret management tools
      3. Audit all log outputs
    prevention: "Use platform secret features, implement log filtering"
    frequency: "Occasional"
    severity: "Critical"
    
  - pattern: "Flaky tests"
    root_cause: "Timing issues, external dependencies"
    solution: |
      1. Add retry logic for tests
      2. Mock external services
      3. Increase timeouts
    prevention: "Write deterministic tests, use test containers"
    frequency: "Very common"
    severity: "Medium"
```

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Pipeline performance analysis
curl -H "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $TOKEN" "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/$PROJECT_ID/pipelines?per_page=100" | \
  jq '[.[] | {id, status, duration: .duration, created: .created_at}]'

# GitHub Actions usage
gh api /repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs --jq '.workflow_runs[] | {name: .name, status: .status, duration: (.updated_at - .created_at)}'

# Docker cleanup
docker system df
docker system prune -af --volumes

# Check runner/agent status
gitlab-runner verify
github-actions-runner status
```

## Cost Optimization Lens

### CI/CD Cost Analysis
```yaml
cost_factors:
  compute:
    - gitlab_runners: [$0.008/min shared, $75/mo dedicated]
    - github_actions: [$0.008/min Linux, $0.016/min Windows]
    - azure_pipelines: [1800 min/mo free, $40/parallel job]
    - jenkins_agents: [EC2/VM costs apply]
  storage:
    - artifacts: [$0.05/GB/month]
    - container_registry: [$0.10/GB/month]
    - cache: [$0.023/GB transfer]
  operations:
    - deployments: [API calls, data transfer]
    - monitoring: [Logs ingestion costs]
    
monthly_calculation: |
  CI/CD Cost = 
    Compute: (Build Minutes × Rate) + (Dedicated Runners × Monthly Rate)
    + Storage: (Artifacts GB × $0.05) + (Registry GB × $0.10)
    + Transfer: (Cache Hits × Size × $0.023)
    + Operations: (Deployments × Cloud API Costs)
```

### Optimization Strategies
- **Quick Wins**:
  - Enable Docker layer caching
  - Parallelize test execution
  - Use shallow git clones
  - Implement job artifacts expiration
  
- **Medium Term**:
  - Optimize Docker images (multi-stage builds)
  - Implement incremental builds
  - Use self-hosted runners for heavy workloads
  - Consolidate similar jobs
  
- **Strategic**:
  - Move to spot instances for runners
  - Implement on-demand environments
  - Use serverless for sporadic jobs

## Compliance Mappings

### Regulatory CI/CD Requirements
| Standard | Requirement | Implementation | Validation |
|----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| SOC2 | Change control | Approval gates + audit logs | Review pipeline history |
| HIPAA | Access control | RBAC + MFA | Check permissions matrix |
| PCI-DSS | Separation of duties | Environment protection | Verify approval chains |
| GDPR | Data protection | Encryption + retention | Audit data handling |

### Security Gates Implementation
```yaml
# GitLab CI Security Template
include:
  - template: Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml
  - template: Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml
  - template: Security/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml
  - template: Security/DAST.gitlab-ci.yml

security-gate:
  stage: gate
  script:
    - |
      CRITICAL=$(cat gl-sast-report.json | jq '[.vulnerabilities[] | select(.severity=="Critical")] | length')
      if [ "$CRITICAL" -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "Critical vulnerabilities found!"
        exit 1
      fi
  artifacts:
    reports:
      sast: gl-sast-report.json
```

## Tool Integration

### Required Tools
```yaml
tools:
  build:
    - name: docker
      version: ">=20.10"
      purpose: "Container builds"
    - name: buildkit
      version: ">=0.10"
      purpose: "Advanced build features"
  security:
    - name: trivy

```

## Safety & Recovery Procedures

### Pre-Deployment Backup
```bash
# Backup current deployment
kubectl get deploy,svc,ingress -n $NAMESPACE -o yaml > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).yaml

# Create database snapshot
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > db-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql

# Tag current production image
docker tag $IMAGE:latest $IMAGE:rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

### Rollback Procedures
```yaml
# GitLab CI Rollback Job
rollback:
  stage: deploy
  when: manual
  script:
    - kubectl set image deployment/$APP $APP=$PREVIOUS_IMAGE -n $NAMESPACE
    - kubectl rollout status deployment/$APP -n $NAMESPACE
  environment:
    name: production
    action: rollback

# GitHub Actions Rollback
- name: Rollback Deployment
  if: failure()
  run: |
    kubectl rollout undo deployment/$APP -n $NAMESPACE
    kubectl rollout status deployment/$APP -n $NAMESPACE
```

### Emergency Recovery
```bash
# Stop all pipelines
gitlab-runner stop
gh workflow disable --all

# Revert to last known good
git revert HEAD --no-edit
git push origin main

# Force redeploy
kubectl delete pods -l app=$APP -n $NAMESPACE
kubectl scale deployment/$APP --replicas=0 -n $NAMESPACE
kubectl scale deployment/$APP --replicas=3 -n $NAMESPACE
```

```

## Validation Commands

### Pre-Pipeline Validation
```bash
# Validate pipeline syntax (GitLab)
gitlab-ci-lint .gitlab-ci.yml

# Validate workflow (GitHub)
gh workflow view workflow.yml

# Check secrets availability
echo "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" --password-stdin

# Verify deployment access
kubectl auth can-i create deployments -n production
```

### Post-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Health check
curl -f $APP_URL/health || exit 1

# Smoke tests
npm run test:smoke

# Performance check
ab -n 1000 -c 10 $APP_URL/ | grep "Requests per second"

# Security scan
trivy image $DEPLOYED_IMAGE
```

  - agent: terra
    what: "Infrastructure deployment pipelines"
    format: "Pipeline templates for IaC"
  - agent: compliance
    what: "Audit logs and deployment evidence"
    format: "JSON audit trail"
  - agent: docs
    what: "Pipeline documentation and runbooks"
    format: "Markdown with examples"
```

## Metrics & Observability

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Build Success Rate**: >95%
- **Mean Time to Deploy**: <30 minutes
- **Pipeline Efficiency**: >70% (active time/total time)
- **Security Finding Fix Rate**: >90% within SLA
- **Cost per Build**: Track and optimize

### Monitoring Dashboards
```yaml
# Prometheus metrics
- pipeline_duration_seconds{stage="build"}
- pipeline_success_rate{branch="main"}
- security_vulnerabilities_total{severity="critical"}
- deployment_frequency{environment="production"}
- lead_time_for_changes_hours
```

## Notes & Considerations

### Best Practices
- Always version your pipeline configurations
- Use pipeline templates for consistency
- Implement branch protection and review requirements
- Cache dependencies aggressively
- Fail fast with early validation
- Use matrix builds for multiple versions
- Implement progressive deployment strategies

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Building on the main branch without PR validation
- Storing secrets in pipeline configuration
- Not setting resource limits for jobs
- Deploying without health checks
- Ignoring flaky tests
- Missing rollback procedures
- Not monitoring pipeline metrics

### Edge Cases
- **Large artifacts**: Use external storage, implement chunking
- **Long-running tests**: Parallelize, use test selection
- **Rate limits**: Implement retries with exponential backoff
- **Network failures**: Add retry logic, use resilient protocols
- **Concurrent deployments**: Implement locking mechanisms
