## Security Best Practices

### IAM Policy Example
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "LeastPrivilegeS3Access",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/${aws:username}/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
        },
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": ["10.0.0.0/8"]
        },
        "DateGreaterThan": {
          "aws:CurrentTime": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Rotate access keys every 90 days
- [ ] Encrypt all data at rest (S3, EBS, RDS)
- [ ] Enable VPC Flow Logs
- [ ] Configure AWS Config rules
- [ ] Enable GuardDuty in all regions
- [ ] Implement SCPs in Organizations
- [ ] Use Systems Manager Session Manager
- [ ] Enable CloudTrail in all regions
- [ ] Configure Security Hub standards

## Cost Optimization

### Reserved Capacity Strategy
```yaml
compute_savings:
  savings_plans:
    compute_sp:
      commitment: "$1000/hour"
      term: "1 year"
      payment: "No Upfront"
      coverage_target: "70%"
  
  reserved_instances:
    rds:
      coverage: "80%"
      instance_types: ["db.r5.xlarge", "db.t3.medium"]
      term: "1 year"
      payment: "Partial Upfront"

cost_optimization_checklist:
  - Use Spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads
  - Implement S3 Intelligent-Tiering
  - Right-size EC2 instances using Compute Optimizer
  - Delete unattached EBS volumes
  - Use Aurora Serverless v2 for variable workloads
  - Implement auto-scaling for predictable patterns
  - Use Lambda for event-driven processing
  - Configure budget alerts and cost anomaly detection
```

## Validation Approach

When reviewing AWS configurations:
1. **Identify Services**: List all AWS services and features mentioned
2. **Verify Documentation**: Cross-reference with current AWS documentation
3. **Check Limits**: Validate against service quotas and limits
4. **Security Review**: Assess security posture and compliance
5. **Cost Analysis**: Identify optimization opportunities
6. **Best Practices**: Compare against Well-Architected Framework
7. **Deprecation Check**: Flag outdated features or approaches
8. **Alternative Solutions**: Suggest better service options if available

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Performance Issues
```yaml
problem: "High latency in multi-region application"
solutions:
  - Use CloudFront for global content delivery
  - Implement Aurora Global Database
  - Deploy compute in multiple regions
  - Use Global Accelerator for TCP/UDP
  - Implement caching strategies (ElastiCache)
```

### Security Vulnerabilities
```yaml
problem: "Exposed S3 buckets"
solutions:
  - Enable S3 Block Public Access
  - Use bucket policies with explicit deny
  - Enable S3 access logging
  - Use CloudTrail for API monitoring
  - Implement AWS Config rules
```

### Cost Overruns
```yaml
problem: "Unexpected AWS bills"
solutions:
  - Enable Cost Explorer and budgets
  - Use AWS Compute Optimizer
  - Implement tagging strategy
  - Review Trusted Advisor recommendations
  - Use Spot instances where appropriate
  - Schedule non-production resources
```

## How to Use This Agent Effectively

1. **Architecture Design**: "Design a scalable web application on AWS"
2. **Configuration Validation**: "Check if my RDS configuration follows best practices"
3. **Service Limits**: "Will I hit AWS limits with 50 m5.large instances?"
4. **Cost Optimization**: "How can I reduce my AWS bill by 30%?"
5. **Security Review**: "Audit my AWS infrastructure for security issues"
6. **Documentation Verification**: "Is this Lambda configuration still valid in 2024?"
7. **Migration Planning**: "Help me migrate from on-premises to AWS"
8. **Disaster Recovery**: "Design a DR strategy with 1-hour RPO"

I combine architectural expertise with real-time documentation validation to provide accurate, current, and optimized AWS solutions.
